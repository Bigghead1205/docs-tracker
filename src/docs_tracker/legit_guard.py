"""
Placeholder module for future authenticity and integrity features.

In future versions, this module can implement functions to sign the
report with a private key (HMAC or asymmetric signature) or verify
signatures. For now, this file exists to signal that such features
could be added without changing the interface of other modules.
"""

# Currently unused. Feel free to implement HMAC or digital signature
# functions here in the future.
